# Scratch-Star-Dash-Escape

Description: You pilot a Rocketship through deep space to collect falling stars for points while evading a persistent Ball that "wakes up" and chases you after the first star is gathered. To increase difficulty, the Ball utilizes a custom Glitch to Position block to teleport closer as you move, requiring you to balance speed and strategy to maximize your survival time and score before being caught.

Controls: Players navigate the Rocketship using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) on the keyboard to maneuver across the screen.
